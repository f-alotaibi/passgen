		<h3>What is the purpose of this website?</h3>
		<p>The main purpose is to make users use randomized passwords/passphrases,<br>since a lot of people use shared passwords in all their accounts, which could be prone to disastrous consequences.</p>
		<h3>I don't know is my passwords have been leaked or not, where do i find out?</h3>
		<p>Visit Have I Been Pwned's <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords">Pwned Passwords</a>.</p>
		<h3>How would i trust this website?</h3>
		<p>This website is being ran on your browser, there isn't any logging.</p>
		<h3>What is a passphrase?</h3>
		<p>A passphrase is a bunch of words that is longer than a typical password, but is easier to remember to the person<br><b>however</b>, a passphrase that has context is much easier to crack hence generated passphases are the preferable choice.</p>
		<h3>What is a password entropy?</h3>
		<p>Password entropy is a measuremeant of how unpredictable a password is and is expressed in terms of bits,<br>the higher the bit, the harder to crack your password,<br>you can check your password's entropy in <a href="strength.html">here</a>.</p>
		<h3>Okay, i generated my passwords, where do i store them?</h3>
		<p>Use a password manager with a master password that <b>YOU DO NOT USE IT ON YOUR ACCOUNTS</b>,<br>the master password is like your PIN code to your credit card, you only use it for only specfifc thing,<br>here is some examples:<br><a href="https://bitwarden.com">Bitwarden</a>: By far the best cloud-based free password manager for me, and the company is very transparent.<br><a href="https://lastpass.com/">Lastpass</a>: another cloud-based password manager you could use, some features are premium only.<br><a href="https://keepass.info/">KeePass</a>: a free and open source local password manager with tons of plugins.<br><a href="https://keepassxc.org/">KeePassXC</a>: Originally forked from KeePass, this is used for platform that KeePass doesn't support properly.</p>
